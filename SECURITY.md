# Security Policy

I take security seriously at Fossil Logic.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose details publicly.**
2. Open a [🔒 Security Issue](https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-tofu/issues/new?template=security.md) and provide a high-level summary.
3. Optionally include your contact information so maintainers can follow up privately.

Maintainers will respond as soon as possible to gather details safely and coordinate a fix.

## Disclosure Policy

We ask researchers and users to:
- Give us time to investigate and patch before sharing details publicly.
- Work with us in good faith to ensure users are not put at risk.
